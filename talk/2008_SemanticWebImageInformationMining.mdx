abstract = "The Semantic web has been proposed by the World Wide Web consortium as a long-term project which will facilitate automatic access and manipulation of data on the web. To accomplish those goals, several standards have been proposed, or are currently being developed like RDF, SPARQL, OWL, RIF, etc. Most of the standards have been implemented and there is a shortage of semantic web technologies which will enable the user to add meta-data on published content, like textual web pages, or multimedia assets, like images or videos. In this presentation we will review the main semantic web technologies and how they can be applied to the image information mining domain."

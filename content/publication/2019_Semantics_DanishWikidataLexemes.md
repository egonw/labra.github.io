abstract = "Two of the newest features of Wikidata are support for lexicographic data (lexemes), and support for Shape Expressions (ShEx). We demonstrate the first application of ShEx for validation of entity data for Wikidata lexemes. Validation of entity data in Wikidata against ShEx schemas allows editors to discover missing or incorrect information. It may also form a basis for discussion of the data models implicitly used in Wikidata. We present a use case and benchmark for ShEx and discuss its current limitations."

abstract = "RDF validation is a field where the Semantic Web community is currently focusing attention. In other communities, like XML or databases, data validation and quality is considered a key part of their ecosystem. Besides, there is a recent trend to migrate data from different sources to semantic web formats. These transformations and mappings between different technologies have an economical and technological impact on society. In order to facilitate this transformation, we propose a set of mappings that can be used to convert from XML Schema to Shape Expressions (ShEx)—a validation language for RDF. We also present a prototype that implements a subset of the mappings proposed, and an example application to obtain a ShEx schema from an XML Schema. We consider that this work and the development of other format mappings could drive to an improvement of data interoperability due to the reduction of the technological gap."

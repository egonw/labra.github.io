abstract = "The talk will be divided in two parts: the first will describe the History of the Law project developed for the Chilean National Library of Congress: a production system that employs Semantic Web technologies, Akoma-Ntoso, and tools that automate the marking of plain text to XML and RDF, enriching and linking documents. These semantically annotated documents enable the development of specialized political and legislative services, and to extract information for a legislative data portal. The second part will be about linked data quality with more emphasis on RDF data description and validation."

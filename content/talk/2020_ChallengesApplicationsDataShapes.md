abstract = "Although RDF can be considered the corner stone of semantic web and knowledge graphs, it has not been embraced by everyday programmers and software architects who want to safely create and access well-structured data. There is a lack of common tools and methodologies that are available in more conventional settings to improve data quality by defining schemas that can later be validated. Two technologies have recently been proposed for RDF validation: Shape Expressions (ShEx) and Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL). In the talk, we will briefly introduce both technologies using some examples and compare them. We will also present some challenges and applications related with data shapes."

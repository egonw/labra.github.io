title = "Validating RDF data: Challenges and perspectives"
abstract = "Although RDF is a corner stone of semantic web and knowledge graphs, it has not been embraced by everyday programmers and software architects who need to safely create and access well-structured data. There is a lack of common tools and methodologies that are available in more conventional settings to improve data quality by defining schemas that can later be validated. Two technologies have recently been proposed for RDF validation: Shape Expressions (ShEx) and Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL). In the talk, we will review the history and motivation of both technologies. We will also and enumerate some challenges and future work with regards to RDF validation. "
